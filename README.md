1. Make sure you have python and pip installed on your system.
2. Install the venv and requirements.txt:
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Ensure your API key is in you environment variables as 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.
    * This can be done with the following code (not in the venv)

```
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<insert your key here>

Windows (CMD):

cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python server.py
