Overview

Critical Tracking

Model Semester Plan

Academic Learning Compact



Students in the engineering computer science (EG-CSE) program will satisfy the same requirements for General Education and obtain the same engineering preprofessional background in mathematics and science as other engineering students. The program contains a strong technical component comprising a set of required courses covering essential areas in computing and a set of technical electives enabling students to deepen their knowledge in chosen areas of computer science and engineering.
In addition, the program includes a set of interdisciplinary electives in an area of the student's choice from anything the university offers. Students may choose an established minor, a predefined track or if nothing meets their needs, they can work with an advisor to develop their own program. Thus, students will not need to wait for an interdisciplinary program to be established; they can create their own.
To answer the demands of industry for employees with both technical competence and the ability to communicate effectively, the program requires communication courses beyond the usual General Education requirements for engineering.
Department Requirements
Students must complete all critical-tracking courses with minimum grades of C in each course and the critical-tracking GPA must be 2.5 minimum. A minimum grade of C is required in all other courses that are prerequisites to a required course: CDA 3101, COP 3502C, COP 3503C, COP 3530, COP 4600, and COT 3100 . In addition, CISE requires all computer science students to maintain a cumulative, upper-division and department grade point average minimum of 2.0.
Students who do not meet these requirements will be placed on academic probation and will be required to prepare a probation contract with a CISE advisor. Students are normally given two terms to remove their deficit points; however, students who do not satisfy the conditions of the first term of probation may be dismissed from the department.
Students may opt to take COP 3504C in lieu of COP 3502C and COP 3503C. If elected, students will need to complete an additional 4 credits to complete the degree program.

  1  Students should check prerequisites when planning their major electives. Students should discuss electives with an advisor in the department. Individual study, co-op, internship, research, and special topics credits must be approved by an advisor in the department.
Technical Electives may also be:

Any 4000-level or higher ECE or PHY course not taken to fulfill some other requirement, excluding EEL 4384 and most CGS courses.
MAP 2302 or any 4000-level math or statistics course with the prefix STA, MAA, MAD, MAP, MAS, or MHF not fulfilling another requirement.

EGN 4038, EGN 4641, EGN 4643, EGS 4038, EGS 4641, or EGS 4643.

Interdisciplinary Electives | Select one option
Option A
14 credits applicable toward formal minor and not counting for other requirements; completion of minor not required if it exceeds 14 credits. If completed minor contributes less than 14 credits, remaining credits can be fulfilled with additional 3000-level coursework in the area of the minor, 3000-level CISE courses, or 3000-level Engineering courses.
Option B
14 credits in a concentration area outside of CISE at 3000-level or higher (advisor approval required).
Option C
14 credits arranged with a department of interest which does not offer a formal minor.

Critical Tracking records each student’s progress in courses that are required for progress toward each major. Please note the critical-tracking requirements below on a per-semester basis.
Equivalent critical-tracking courses as determined by the State of Florida Common Course Prerequisites may be used for transfer students.

Students are expected to complete the General Education International (GE-N) and Diversity (GE-D) requirements. This is often done concurrently with another General Education requirement (typically, GE-C, H or S).
To remain on track, students must complete the appropriate critical-tracking courses, which appear in bold. These courses must be completed by the terms as listed above in the Critical Tracking criteria.
This semester plan represents an example progression through the major. Actual courses and course order may be different depending on the student's academic record and scheduling availability of courses. Prerequisites still apply.
